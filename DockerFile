# Step 1: Use Node.js as the base image for building the React app
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --frozen-lockfile

# Step 5: Copy the entire project to the working directory
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use Nginx as the base image for serving the built React app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Step 8: Copy the built files from the builder stage to Nginx's public directory
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose the default Nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Start Nginx in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
